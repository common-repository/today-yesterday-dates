This plugin changes the creation dates of posts to relative dates for posts that are dated today or yesterday (relative to the current time, i.e. <strong>Today at 11:45</strong> or <strong>Yesterday at 9:15</strong>).

== Description ==

Today-Yesterday Dates is a small, simple plugin that automatically changes the creation dates of posts relative to the current time (only for today and yesterday). In other words, the dates will now look like <strong>Today at 11:45</strong> or <strong>Yesterday at 9:15</strong>.

If a post's creation date no longer meets the criteria for "Today" or "Yesterday," the plugin will not change it, and it will be displayed in the default format.
